# ShopSystem
A simple shop system written in Java. Users can view available items, add them to their cart with specified quantities, and checkout. The program maintains a predefined inventory and ensures that duplicate items in the cart are grouped with their respective quantities. Upon checkout, a unique invoice file is generated for each transaction. The project uses Java's `HashMap` for managing inventory and cart, and `FileWriter` for invoice generation.
